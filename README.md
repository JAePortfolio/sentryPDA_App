# TF2 Sentry PDA App
This is a repository for the source code of my smartphone application that 
acts as the Engineer's PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) from TF2. 

# Description
This project is to create a real working PDA for the sentry on a smartphone.
It will display the sentry's health, ammo and current status (sapped, needs repair).
It will also show some animations for when the sentry is firing, being sapped, etc. 
There will be a few buttons to reset some of these variables. The app will 
create a bluetooth connection between the phone and the STM in the sentry. 
The STM part of the project can be found
[here](https://github.com/JAePortfolio/sentryTF2).
